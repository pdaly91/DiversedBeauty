            Handmade with Love: Product Variations
          </h2>

            At Diversed Beauty, we take great pride in the craftsmanship of our products. Each item is handcrafted with love, care, and attention to detail. We believe that the human touch adds a unique and personal quality to our cosmetics.
          </p>

            Due to the handmade nature of our products, it&apos;s important to note that variations in color, texture, and appearance may occur from one item to another. And due to the nature of our natural ingredients, there may appear to be separation with glosses that contain shimmer but fear not! The quality and fabulousness are not affected! These slight differences are a testament to the individuality and uniqueness of each product, making it one-of-a-kind.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            We believe that these variations add character and charm to our offerings, and we hope you appreciate the beauty of handmade products. As a result, we kindly ask our customers to embrace and celebrate these natural variations as part of the Diversed Beauty experience.
